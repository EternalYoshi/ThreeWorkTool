# ThreeWorkTool

This is a GUI Tool I made to make it easier to extract, rename, and insert files into Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3's Archive files.

As of now that's all it can do. More functionality will be added over time.

Expect weirdness and glitches. They will be fixed over time as well.

This is built targeting .NET Framework 4.7 if that concerns anyone.
